## BLOCKSPRING-RELATED items and feedback

### Comparison to AWS Lambda

 * Blockspring is poised to become a user-friendly variant of the AWS Lambda service
 * http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/

### Blockspring function input as arbitrary JSON struct

Currently, blockspring web-gui allows function input arguments in the form of:
   * scalar name-value pairs
   * file-input
   * spreadsheet-like-grid

It would be great if the blockspring web-gui could also allow input arguments in the form of arbitrarily-sized JSON structs
